Scrumban - Karumi Project Methodology 

## 


## Goals
Teams following our methodology are expected to deliver quality features on schedule.

## Commitment

Team members personally commit to achieving team goals.

## Focus

Concentrate on the work identified for the sprint and the goals of the team.

## Practices
### Events
#### Sprint

The Sprint is a timebox of one week during which the team produces a potentially shippable product **Increment**.

#### Sprint Planning

The team starts out a Sprint with a discussion to determine which items from the product backlog they will work on during the Sprint.  The end result of Sprint Planning is the Sprint Backlog.

Sprint Planning typically occurs in two parts. In the first part, the product owner and the rest of the team agree on which product backlog items will be included in the Sprint.

In the Second Part of Sprint Planning, the team determines how they will successfully deliver the identified product backlog items as part of the potentially shippable product increment.  The team may identify specific tasks necessary to make that happen if that is one of their practices.  The product backlog items identified for delivery and tasks if applicable, makes up the Sprint Backlog.

Once the team and product owner establish the scope of the Sprint as described by the product backlog items no more items can be added to the Sprint Backlog. This protects the team from scope changes within that Sprint.

#### Daily Scrum

The Daily Scrum is a short (usually limited to 5 minutes) discussion where the team coordinates their activities for the following day. The Daily Scrum is not intended to be a status reporting meeting or a problem solving discussion.

#### Increment Review

As soon as increment is in a reviewable state the product owner reviews it. The purpose is to demonstrate, and potentially give the stakeholders a chance to use, the increment in order to get feedback. Feedback from the increment review gets placed into the Product Backlog for future consideration.

### Artifacts
#### Product Backlog
The product backlog is an ordered list of all the possible changes that could be made to the product.  Items on the product backlog are options, not commitments in that just because they exist on the Product Backlog does not guarantee they will be delivered.

The Product Owner maintains the product backlog on an ongoing basis including its content, availability, and ordering.


#### Sprint Backlog
The Sprint Backlog is the collection of product backlog items selected for delivery in the Sprint, and if the team identifies tasks, the tasks necessary to deliver those product backlog items and achieve the Sprint Goal.


#### Increment

The increment is the collection of the Product Backlog Items that meet the team’s Definition of Done by the end of the Sprint.  The Product Owner may decide to release the increment or build upon it in future Sprints.

#### Definition of Done

The definition of done is a team’s shared agreement on the criteria that a Product Backlog Item must meet before it is considered done.

### Roles
#### The Product Owner - Service Request Manager

The product owner is a role team responsible for managing the product backlog in order to achieve the desired outcome that the team seeks to accomplish.

The product owner role exists in Scrum to address challenges that product development teams had with multiple, conflicting direction, or no direction at all with respect to what to build.

### The Scrum Master - Service Delivery Manager
The scrum master is the team role responsible for ensuring the team lives agile values and principles and follows the processes and practices that the team agreed they would use.

The role does not have any actual authority and any one from the devlopment teams can take the responsability.

#### The Development Team
The development team consists of the people who deliver the product increment inside a Sprint.

The main responsibility of the development team is to deliver the increment that delivers value every Sprint. How the work is divided up to do that is left up to the team to determine based on the conditions at that time.

### Lifecycle
Because work items tend to flow through a kanban system in single piece flow, and each system is different with respect to stages in its workflow, the best way to describe the lifecycle of the Kanban method is via the feedback loops involved.

Those feedback loops (cadences) are:

#### Strategy Review (Quarterly)

Select the services to provide and the context in which those services are appropriate.

#### Operations Review (Monthly)

Understand the balance between and across services, including deploying people and resources to maximize value delivery

#### Risk Review (Monthly)

Understand and respond to delivery risks in services

#### Service Delivery Review (Bi-Weekly)

Examine and improve the effectiveness of a service.  This is similar to a retrospective that is focused on improving the kanban system.

#### Replenishment Meeting - Sprint Planning (Weekly)

Identify items that the team will work on and determine which work items may be selected next.

#### The Kanban Meeting - Daily Scrum (Daily)

A team working on a service coordinates their activities for the day.

#### Delivery Planning Meeting (Per Delivery Cadence)

Monitor and plan deliveries to customers. They can go from Daily to Weekly based on the scope of the Increment. Week without increment should be avoided.


This methodology allows our development teams flexibility to respond to changing situations. This framework has sufficient control points in place to ensure the team does not stray from the desired outcome, and that issues can be identified and resolved and process adjustments made while the effort is still underway.

The Scrum Lifecycle starts with a prioritized backlog, but does not provide any guidance as to how that backlog is developed or prioritized.

The Scrum Lifecycle consists of a series of Sprints, where the end result is a potentially shippable product increment. Inside of these sprints, all of the activities necessary for the development of the product occur on a small subset of the overall product.  Below is a description of the key steps in the Scrum Lifecycle:

1. Establish the Product Backlog.
1. The product owner and development team conduct Sprint Planning. Determine the scope of the Sprint in the first part of Sprint Planning and the plan for delivering that scope in the second half of Sprint Planning.
1. As the Sprint progresses, development team perform the work necessary to deliver the selected product backlog items.
1. On a daily basis, the development team coordinate their work in a Daily Scrum. The development also Increment Review to show the customer the increment that are ready and get feedback.
1. The Team repeats steps 2–4 until the desired outcome of the product have been met.
